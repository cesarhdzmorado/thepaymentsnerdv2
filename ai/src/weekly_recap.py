CONTEXT:
- Today's date: {current_date}
- This is a FRIDAY RECAP because we had a slower news week
- We already covered these stories this week:

{weekly_stories_formatted}

YOUR MISSION:
Since this is a slower week, find 3-5 stories from our usual sources that either:
1. Were published this week but we MISSED (new stories we haven't covered)
2. Have SIGNIFICANT NEW DEVELOPMENTS since we last covered them
3. Are evergreen analysis/trends pieces that add strategic value

**🚨 CRITICAL ANTI-DUPLICATION PROTOCOL 🚨**

BEFORE selecting ANY story, CHECK THE "WE ALREADY COVERED" LIST ABOVE.

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST:**
1. Is this company/topic in our weekly coverage? → Check the list carefully
2. Does this story have NEW information not already covered? → Compare details
3. If it's the same event/announcement we covered → REJECT IMMEDIATELY

**EXPLICIT EXAMPLES:**

If we already covered "Barclays Invests in Ubyx for Stablecoin Settlement":
- ❌ REJECT: "Barclays makes stablecoin play with Ubyx" (same story, different source)
- ❌ REJECT: "Barclays enters tokenized money via Ubyx stake" (same event, reworded)
- ✅ ACCEPT: "Barclays Ubyx investment triggers competitor responses from HSBC, Citi" (NEW reactions)

If we already covered "Flutterwave Acquires Mono":
- ❌ REJECT: "Flutterwave buys Nigerian fintech Mono" (same acquisition)
- ✅ ACCEPT: "Flutterwave-Mono integration complete, processing 50K transactions/day" (NEW milestone)

**QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:**
- 3 excellent NEW stories >> 5 stories with 2 duplicates
- DO look for: follow-ups, new data, market reactions, competitive responses
- PREFER stories published in last 48 hours if possible
- Better to return 2-3 truly new stories than pad with duplicates

Sources to check:
{news_sources_str}

Current industry trends for context:
{trends_context}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each story, provide:

---
STORY [N] - [HEADLINE]

Source: [Publication] - [URL]

WHAT HAPPENED:
[2-3 sentences with facts and data]

WHY IT MATTERS:
[Strategic significance]

COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS:
[Who wins, who loses]

FORWARD LOOK:
[What to watch next week]
---

Return 3-5 stories maximum. Quality over quantity."""),

CONTEXT:
- Today: {current_date} (Friday)
- This week was SLOWER for breaking news
- We're sending a recap because we only sent 1-3 daily newsletters this week

**🚨 CRITICAL: FINAL ANTI-DUPLICATION CHECK 🚨**

The Researcher should have filtered out duplicates, but YOU are the final gatekeeper.

Before selecting ANY story, verify it's not a duplicate of something we already covered this week.
If a story is about the SAME event with NO new information → REJECT IT.
Better to have 3 genuinely new stories than 5 stories with duplicates.

YOUR MISSION: Transform the research into a weekly recap with EXTENDED ANALYSIS.

WEEKLY RECAP FORMAT (Different from daily):

**INTRO (Required, 2-3 sentences):**
- Acknowledge slower week: "Slower week for breaking news, but here's what mattered..."
- Tease the week's theme or biggest story
- Set tone: strategic analysis over breaking news

**STORIES (3-5 stories with EXTENDED ANALYSIS):**

Each story should have:

**TITLE** (10-14 words):
- Same high-quality standards as daily newsletter
- Lead with insight

**BODY** (6-8 sentences - LONGER than daily):

Sentence 1-2: THE WHAT (Facts)
- What happened, when, who was involved
- Key metrics and data points

Sentence 3-4: THE WHY (Strategic Impact)
- Why this matters to payments professionals
- Business model / infrastructure implications

Sentence 5-6: THE HOW (Competitive Analysis)
- How this changes competitive dynamics
- Who benefits, who's threatened
- Second-order effects

Sentence 7-8: THE NEXT (Forward Looking)
- What to watch next week/month
- Predictions or trend signals
- Questions to consider

**PERSPECTIVE (Required, 3-4 sentences):**
- "This week in payments..."
- Connect the stories to larger trends
- Forward-looking view on next week
- Call to action or question to ponder

**CURIOSITY (Same as daily):**
- Interesting fact, payments or general

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM DAILY:**
1. Stories are LONGER (6-8 sentences vs 3-4)
2. More analytical depth
3. Forward-looking "what's next" angle
4. Intro acknowledges slower week
5. Perspective includes "next week" preview

OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST BE VALID JSON):

  "intro": "2-3 sentence intro acknowledging slower week and teasing content",
  "news": [

      "title": "...",

QUALITY CHECKS:

WEEKLY RECAP QUALITY CHECKS:

1. **Story Length:**
   - Each story should be 6-8 sentences (count them!)
   - If shorter, it's not meeting recap standards

2. **Extended Analysis:**
   - Stories should have: facts, why it matters, competitive dynamics, forward look
   - Not just breaking news summary

3. **Forward-Looking:**
   - Each story should have "what to watch next" angle
   - Perspective should preview next week

4. **Intro Framing:**
   - Should acknowledge slower week
   - Set appropriate expectations (analysis over breaking news)

5. **Completeness:**
   - 3-5 stories (quality over quantity for slow weeks)
   - All required fields present
   - Proper JSON formatting
