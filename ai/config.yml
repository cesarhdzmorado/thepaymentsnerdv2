  - name: "Agentic AI in Payments"
    weight: 8
    description: "Agentic commerce is moving from pilots to early scale, led by repeat-buy (grocery) and search-heavy categories (apparel, travel, tickets). Protocols and standards (e.g., ACP, MCP, Agentic Al Foundation) are improving interoperability; payment networks are enabling agent-optimized rails via tokenization. Merchant distribution is shifting toward Al surfaces (Operator, Instant Checkout), showing higher-intent traffic and conversion lifts. Trust, safety, and fraud tooling are becoming essential as agent flows often lack traditional signals. 2026 looks like a 'scale-and-experiment' year; medium-term estimates: $2-5T in agentic transaction volume by 2030 (=3-7% of global payment volume).
