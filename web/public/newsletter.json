      "body": "Starting January 1, 2026, the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require platforms in 48 jurisdictions to collect detailed customer information and report transactions to tax authorities. This regulation increases compliance costs for crypto platforms, potentially favoring larger exchanges that can absorb these expenses.
