# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that has been superseded by the current docs.

## Archived Files

### Email Compliance Documentation (Consolidated)

These three files have been **consolidated into [../EMAIL_SYSTEM.md](../EMAIL_SYSTEM.md)**:

- **ICLOUD_EMAIL_COMPLIANCE.md** - Original iCloud compliance requirements
- **ICLOUD_FIX_WALKTHROUGH.md** - Step-by-step iCloud fix guide
- **APPLE_COMPLIANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Implementation improvements for Apple compliance

**Why consolidated:** Overlapping content, easier to maintain single source of truth.

### Implementation Documentation (Completed)

These files document completed features and are kept for historical reference:

- **REDESIGN_PLAN_V2.md** - Design plan for v2.0 (completed)
- **V2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of v2.0 implementation (completed)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Growth engine implementation guide (completed)

**Why archived:** Features have been implemented. Current state documented in main README and ARCHITECTURE.md.
